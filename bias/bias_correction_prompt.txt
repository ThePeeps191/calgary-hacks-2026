We are working on a project where we are editing news articles to be unbiased. You will be given a biased paragraph from a news article and you need to edit it to be unbiased.
BE CAREFUL. Only edit paragraphs that are relevant, i.e, contain specific information or contribute to the article. Advertisements, jokes, unserious things such as memes etc. are not considered relevant and you
should not change such things. However, if the paragraph is relevant, your output should be as follows:

- Paragraph edited to be unbiased in one line
- New line
- Reason paragraph was biased in one line.

Do not output anything else.
