We are working on a project where we are editing news articles to be unbiased. You will be given a paragraph from a news article and you need to determine if it is biased enough to warrant changing the paragraph. If it is biased enough, output the string "true". If it is not biased enough, output the string "false". A source is biased if it is clearly left-leaning or right leaning or presents simply untrue facts. Check for these conditions and determine if the source is biased.
